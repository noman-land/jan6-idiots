She told agents she had been in the U.S. for 21 years and was a Trump supporter, attended his rallies and was blocked from Facebook and Twitter for some of her pro-Trump postings. ",

Bauer reiterated to the FBI that he marched to the Capitol \"because President Trump said to do so.\"\n\nBauer told the FBI that he entered the Capitol building with a crowd of others, while his wife stayed outside. He said he didn't think he had done anything wrong and had no intention of fighting anyone. After he entered the building, Bauer remembered meeting a police officer. According to Bauer in the court documents, the officer shook his hand and told him, \"It's your house now.\" Bauer said he thought the officer was acting out of fear.\n\nBauer explained to the FBI that \"people in the crowd were angry about pedophiles, the news cycle, and losing their businesses during the lockdown.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. Navy veteran Thomas Caldwell was indicted on federal conspiracy and other charges in connection with the Capitol riot. \n\nFederal prosecutors allege Caldwell is affiliated with the far-right Oath Keepers militia and say he was involved in planning and coordinating the breach of the U.S. Capitol, with at least two other individuals who are also indicted on conspiracy charges. That coordinating, prosecutors say, includes an attempt to reach out to the Three Percenters militia group in the days leading up to the insurrection to \"discuss plans to transport weapons across the Potomac by boat.\" \n\nAccording to court documents, on Jan. 1, 2021, Caldwell replied to a Facebook comment, writing, \"I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic. I did the former, I have done the latter peacefully but they have morphed into pure evil even blatantly rigging an election and paying off the political caste. We must smite them now and drive them down.\"\n\nOn Jan. 6, as a crowd descended on the U.S. Capitol, Caldwell allegedly sent a Faceook message, writing, \"We are surging forward. Doors breached.\" Minutes later, Caldwell wrote, \"Inside.\"\n\nFederal investigators found that while Caldwell was at the Capitol, he received a message from an unnamed individual who said, “All members are in the tunnels under capital [sic] seal them in. Turn on gas.”\n\nLater that evening, after the National Guard secured the Capitol building, investigators believe Caldwell sent a Facebook message to another rioter also facing conspiracy charges. “We need to do this at the local level,\" he said. \"Lets [sic] storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!” \n\nIn a motion for his release from detention, Caldwell's lawyer revealed that after he retired from the armed forces Caldwell served as an FBI section chief from 2009-2010 and has held a top-secret security clearance since 1979. The court filing also indicates Caldwell formed and operated a consulting firm that has done business for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Coast Guard and the Army Personnel Command. \n\nProsecutors opposed the motion, citing, among other things, a search of Caldwell's residence in Virginia, where federal investigators allegedly found a document labeled \"Death List.\" \n\n\"Handwritten on the document was the name of an election official from another state,\" said prosecutors. They have not identified that official.\n\n",

The caller read some of the messages, including one that allegedly said, \"We are going to kill every last communist who stands in Trump's way.\" \n\nFederal investigators believe Calhoun was part of the first group of rioters who breached the Capitol building, based on photographs and posts they found on Calhoun's Facebook page. In one post he said, \"Patriots have taken the Capitol Building. We overran multiple police barricades and swarmed the building. We busted through – thousands of us swarmed in.” He also said he was \"among the first\" who \"kicked in Nancy Pelosi’s office door and pushed down the hall toward her inner sanctum.”\n\nThe judge presiding over the case said Calhoun was \"seduced by a dangerous and violent ideology,\" citing his social media threats to \"wage a civil war against Democrats, communists, the Deep State, and BLM-Antifa.\" \n\n",

Photographs of him, with long brown hair and wearing a Trump hat, were posted on Instagram. One reads: “I wouldn’t want anyone other than you with me to take on the revolution.” It was followed by a heart and a kiss emoji. The FBI confirmed that Cooke is the person in the photographs.\n\nCooke voluntarily agreed to be interviewed by law enforcement in Texas and said that he drove to Washington on Jan. 5 with a relative and his girlfriend after seeing a posting on Twitter for a Trump rally there on Jan. 6.\n\nCooke told officials that he had brought several firearms with him on the trip but that he left the weapons in the car. \n\nCooke said he was at the front of the crowd and pushed past police officers to get to the Capitol building and used a flagpole to bang on a window, but he denied that he went inside.\n\n",

She was seen entering the building through a door near the West Senate Stairs at 2:42 p.m. About 15 minutes later, cameras caught her on the second floor, near the Senate chamber, carrying a “Members Only” sign. A law enforcement officer took the sign away from her a few moments later, just before she left the building.\n\nThe FBI was provided with screenshots of a direct message between Courtright and a friend on Instagram. It included a video of Courtright chanting as she went through the halls of the Capitol. Her friend asked whether she was there, and Courtright responded by saying that she walked into “the chamber like the Senate where desks are.” \n\n“It wasn’t violent like the news said, I took pictures all in the building,” the message began. “I never saw the violence i guess I was lucky. The cops like let’s (sic) us walk in.”\n\nShortly before her Instagram account was deactivated around Jan. 7, she wrote below a selfie: “Infamy is just as good as fame.

According to court documents, Crowl, a U.S. Marine veteran, is a member of the Ohio State Regular Militia, a group with links to the far-right Oath Keepers militia. Federal prosecutors allege that in December 2020, Crowl attended a training camp in North Carolina. In a review of Crowl's Facebook posts, federal investigators found a message he sent on Jan. 4, 2021, that said, \"Sorry Brother, been busy planning for this week. ... We are enroute to DC right now for a few days on an Oathkeepers Op.\" Two days later, prosecutors say Crowl and another individual also indicted on conspiracy charges -- Jessica Watkins -- were in full battle gear at the Capitol when they joined other members of the Oath Keepers and \"moved in an organized and practiced fashion up the steps\" of the Capitol. According to charging documents, Crowl and Watkins forcibly entered the Capitol building, pushing past at least one law enforcemnt officer, and made it into the Capitol Rotunda. In a recorded video, Crowl allegedly said, \"We took on the Capitol! We overran the Capitol!\" Federal prosecutors say Crowl returned to Ohio after the attack on the Capitol, but once the media idenfitied him, he traveled to Virginia to stay with another alleged rioter facing conspiracy charges -- Thomas Caldwell. According to the indictment, \"Caldwell directed Crowl to conceal his travel and invited him to hide evidence of his involvement in the Capitol incursion, writing, 'No need to call me again. Will expect you even if you're running late.'\" On Jan. 17, 2021, Crowl was arrested in Ohio along with Jessica Watkins. They turned themselves in, according to the Urbana Police Department.",

The documents say Ehmke found a window that led into the Capitol office building and beat on it with his fist until it shattered. An officer knocked Ehmke over with his shield, the two fell to the ground, and Ehmke was handcuffed.\n\nThe police officers in the area, however, were quickly overwhelmed by the crowd, the court filing says, and someone in the crowd told the officer who had Ehmke in custody that he would not be able to leave with him. Given the menace growing within the crowd, the officers took Ehmke’s driver’s license and released him. He was arrested in California a week later. \n\nThe Architect of the Capitol has estimated that the cost to replace the broken window is $2,821.",

Grider said he witnessed the police shooting of Ashli Babbitt, who was killed by a Capitol Police officer while trying to climb through a broken window inside the Capitol. \n\nProsecutors allege that Grider handed his helmet to another rioter, who used the helmet to break the glass window that Babbitt then tried to climb through. Grider also allegedly \"attempted to push open the doors and then kick the doors in an attempt to breach the entrance leading to House Chamber where members of Congress were located.\" \n\nGrider was arrested in Austin, Texas, on Jan. 21, 2021, and was indicted on multiple charges, including destruction of government property, on Jan. 26, 2021.",

According to federal prosecutors, Griffin spoke to the growing crowd outside the Capitol with a bullhorn and entered into restricted areas by the steps of the Capitol. He has not been charged with entering the Capitol building. \n\nGriffin has repeatedly questioned the results of the 2020 presidential election and has been a staunch ally of Donald Trump. He has been photographed with Trump inside the Oval Office. At times, Griffin has used violent rhetoric — for example, stating that \"the only good Democrat is a dead Democrat.\" (He later said that he meant no physical harm to Democrats.) The day after the Capitol insurrection, according to court documents, he also said he planned to return to Washington, D.C., and said, \"we could have a 2nd Amendment rally on those same steps that we had that rally yesterday. You know, and if we do, then it's gonna be a sad day, because there's gonna be blood running out of that building.\"\n\nFBI agents interviewed Griffin about his actions on Jan. 6, and the agents said in a memo that \"Griffin was proud of the turnout and commented that seeing the 'patriots' claiming control of the Capitol 'by God it felt pretty damn good.' \"\n\nGriffin was arrested on Jan. 17, 2021, and faces charges of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority. \n\nGriffin's attorney has highlighted the fact that his charge relates only to his alleged presence in restricted areas outside the Capitol.\n\n\"The only conviction in his criminal history is a DUI almost 25 year ago,\" his attorney stated in one court filing. \"He is a part of a large and loving family, including a sister and brothers and seven-year-old son, who are deeply concerned for his welfare, familiar with his case, and steeped in respect for law enforcement.\"",

Sabol \"acknowledged that the video seemed to depict him throwing punches at the police officer,\" prosecutors say, but Sabol claimed he was just \"patting him on the back.\" Sabol allegedly told investigators that he picked up the officer's baton at one point, and claimed he used it to protect the officer, but later said \"he could not recall if he hit the police officer with the baton because he was in a fit of rage and the details are cloudy.\"\n\nProsecutors claim that Sabol had bought a plane ticket and was attempting to flee to Switzerland before he was arrested.\n\nThe Denver Post reported that Sabol's lawyer said Sabol had been steadily employed for decades as a geophysicist and had the support of family. But a federal judge denied his request for release, referring to the charges against Sabol as \"very disturbing.\"",

In the video, captioned “Peacefully Storming the Capitol…#StopTheSteal,” Simon can allegedly be heard saying, “In the Capitol baby, yeah!”  Other Facebook photos allegedly show Simon and an unidentified woman also posing around the Capitol grounds. \n\nSimon described his experience to Epoch Times, a right-wing newspaper. Simon told the newspaper that he attended the rally in support of President Trump, explaining that the crowd was made up of “frustrated patriots” who “just wanted to be heard.” “If the patriots wanted to get in there and cause damage or burn the Capitol down or get Congress or hurt anybody, they would have got hurt,” he said. “They had full control of the place. Cops had no control throughout the day. We could have gone wherever we wanted at any time, and it was not done. They were restrained.”",

Among other things, she was filmed by an ITV news crew inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The footage shows her yelling, “Upstairs, upstairs, upstairs” while she was physically directing people up a staircase. \n\nThe charging documents say that the staircase led to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office. Williams’ mother allegedly confirmed to authorities that the woman in the images is her daughter. Authorities also matched the image to Williams’ driver’s license, the court documents say.\n\nWilliams, who worked at a social services organization called Keystone Human Services before her arrest, also appears to have filmed and then shared a video of someone lifting a laptop off a desk in Pelosi’s office. Underneath the post she allegedly shared on the social media site Discord, she wrote: “STOLE S*** FROM NANCY POLESI.” \n\nThere were a number of other posts, riddled with typographical errors, the court documents say authorities have linked to Williams. One read: \"I TOOK HER GRAVEL HAMMWR TBING.\" Another read: \"I DOMT CARE I TOOK NANCY POLESIS HARD DRIVES I DONT CARE KILL ME.\"\n\nThe FBI and charging documents did not provide any additional information on the whereabouts of the Pelosi laptop -- which, according to the speaker’s office, was only used for presentations. Court documents say Williams’ mother told authorities that her daughter had taken a sudden interest in President Trump’s politics and “far right message boards.” \n\nIn a video obtained by the investigative research group Bellingcat, Riley is purportedly seen giving a Nazi salute while wearing baseball cap embossed with the Nazi black sun symbol. The video is believed to have been shot and posted sometime in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack. Williams' lawyer says it was a joke intended to mock Nazis. \n",

The videos also included the breaching of a door and the sound of a gunshot heard off-camera.\n\nIn interviews with the FBI, four of McCreary’s co-workers confirmed his identity and recognized him in a photograph with Jacob Chansley, the so-called \"QAnon shaman\" who stormed the Capitol with a painted face and horned headdress. They also said McCreary expressed political beliefs at work, including “the belief that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 Presidential Election\" and said McCreary told a co-worker that he “raided” the Capitol. \n\nMcCreary later voluntarily provided a statement to the FBI regarding his participation in the Capitol breach. He said that he understood that going into the building “might not have been legal” but that “he made a personal choice at that point.” In an interview with local news, McCreary, who has since lost his job, said he's worried about the consequences of possible jail time. “The thought of losing my daughter is regularly overwhelming,” he said. “I have never cried as much as I have the past weekend.”",

It’s time to take our freedom back the old fashioned way.”\n\nThe FBI allegedly received two tips identifying Cua as the man in a New Yorker video who stood in the Senate chamber on Jan. 6. He wore a dark sweatshirt, a jean jacket, a red “Make America Great Again” hat and gray gloves, according to court documents, and his clothing helped authorities identify his movements and actions throughout the Capitol that day. Surveillance video inside the Capitol allegedly showed him in the same clothes wielding a baton and trying various office doors. \n\nIn a criminal complaint, federal prosecutors cite a Jan. 6 Instagram post in which Cua allegedly wrote,”Yes, we physically fought our way in.” Another post read: “Yes, for everyone asking I stormed the [Capitol] with hundreds of thousands of patriots. I’ll do a whole video explaining what happened, this is history. What happened was unbelievable.”\n\nAnother tipster, according to court documents, told authorities that Cua had been talking about going to Washington on his Parler account for days and “actively encouraged the events on the sixth for 11 days leading up to the domestic terrorist attack,” the complaint said. \n\nCua, who is believed to be the youngest person so far to be charged with storming the Capitol, allegedly assaulted a federal officer. Once inside the Senate chamber, The New Yorker video allegedly shows Cua responding to someone who ordered someone else not to sit in the vice president’s chair.

According to law enforcement, strips of orange tape on some of Chrestman's belongings help link him to several others and is allegedly a sign that the group was strategically working together.

In another video detailed by the FBI, Chrestman turns to face the mob and yells, \"Do you want your house back?\" The crowd responded \"Yes!\" and Chrestman yelled back \"Take it!\" Later, Chrestman is seen in Capitol security footage in a tunnel underneath the building, using his wooden club or ax handle to prevent a metal barrier from closing, which the FBI says would have secured certain areas of the Capitol if closed. He and others are charged with conspiracy, one of the more serious allegations faced by those who breached the Capitol. \n\nChrestman's attorneys argued in a legal filing that he and other Proud Boys believed they were following Donald Trump's lead when they breached the Capitol. \"The mob was given explicit permission and encouragement by the former President to do what they did,\" they argued.

In parts of the broadcast, he is depicted showing a folder on his computer named “Captiol [sic] Storming,” which appears to have around 50 photos and videos saved to it, the FBI said.\n\nIn a video he showed, Gonzalez is allegedly seen breaking into the Capitol with other rioters while saying, “We’re taking our country back.” He narrates that other rioters were looking for “doors to break in” and that law enforcement was probably told to “stand down, do not f*** with them, you guys will get hurt.” According to the complaint, as Gonzalez keeps narrating photos, he can be heard saying, “This is footage from my camera. This is me there, I’m speaking from firsthand experience” and “I’m showing everyone how I barged into the Capitol.” In the broadcast, Gonzalez also allegedly explains that he smoked marijuana inside the Capitol and that he gave the additional “joints” he had on him to fellow rioters.\n",

Federal prosecutors say that is a reference to the America First podcast hosted by Nick Fuentes, a prominent white supremacist. (The court records do not use Fuentes' name but appear to reference him as \"a public figure known for making racist statements and denying the Holocaust.\") \n\nSecor, prosecutors say, also posted on the video-streaming platform DLive under the name \"Scuffed Elliot Rodger,\" an apparent reference to the man who killed six people in Isla Vista, Calif., in 2014. \n\nThe FBI learned of Secor's alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 insurrection when it received tips from at least 11 witnesses. One of those witnesses allegedly told investigators that Secor is a self-described fascist who \"openly posted calls for America to become a whites-only nation.\" During the Capitol riot, Secor can allegedly be seen on video sitting in the chair of the Senate presiding officer, where Vice President Mike Pence had been seated just hours earlier. In one video, prosecutors allege, Secor was seen among \"a group of rioters attempting to push through a doorway that is blocked by no less than three police officers\" and \"breaking through a police line.\"\n\nAfter the rioting, one witness told the FBI that Secor moved back in with his mother in Costa Mesa, Calif., and then \"got rid of his phone and car and bragged that he would not be caught for his involvement at the U.S. Capitol.\" The FBI conducted surveillance of Secor in late January, according to court documents, and he was arrested on Feb. 16, 2021.",

According to court documents, Klein held top-secret security clearance at the time. In various body camera footage, Klein is allegedly seen fighting officers and trying to breach a police line to enter the Capitol. At one point, an officer sprayed a chemical irritant that forced Klein to move away. Investigators say Klein also incited the mob. Video footage allegedly shows Klein calling on the crowd behind him to send \"fresh people\" to help break through the police line multiple times. Other videos from that day also place Klein at a scene right outside the Capitol building where a police officer had been dragged into the crowd. As other officers tried to recover their colleague, they urged rioters to move. Klein is allegedly seen and heard responding, \"No way.\" Klein worked on Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2016 and started working at the State Department shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, according to a financial disclosure report. A State Department spokesperson said Klein served as a special assistant in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. A former colleague told Politico he was later transferred to the office that handles Freedom of Information Act requests. Klein resigned from the State Department on Jan. 19, 2021.

The New York Times' report is now cited in the Justice Department's case against Minuta. Minuta allegedly appeared alongside other members of the militia in Washington, wearing tactical gear, including \"ballistic goggles,\" and may have also carried bear spray. Minuta \"aggressively taunted and berated law enforcement officers guarding the Capitol,\" the government alleges, before eventually breaching the Capitol himself.

Multiple witnesses confirmed to the FBI that Camper went inside the U.S. Capitol building carrying a GoPro camera on a stick. Days later, Camper told FBI agents in an interview that “in my mind, we were going to take the Capitol steps.” He also said he entered the building through a small door that led to the Rotunda and then proceeded to a room “with statues.” According to court documents, Camper told the FBI they couldn't review the footage he took on his camera if they would use the content against him. In a sentencing memorandum filed in federal court, Camper is identified as having military service. In that memo, a U.S. prosecutor wrote: \"While Camper’s military service is laudable, it renders his conduct on January 6 all the more egregious. As a former military member, Camper was well aware that taxpayer status does not bestow upon a person the right to enter restricted government buildings. His voluntary decision to storm a guarded government building is nothing short of shocking in light of his former military service and training.\"",

He clarified to the FBI he “was so emotional and invested in the moment, he briefly forgot he was in the Capitol building and not the White House.”\nThe video also includes a heavy thud, which Witcher said was someone throwing a fire extinguisher at police officers. Witcher can be heard shouting, “Don’t do that! No, no! No! These are not our enemies,” according to the criminal complaint.\nThe complaint said Witcher was hesitant but eventually identified a fellow Marine, Richard Barnard, who accompanied him inside the Capitol building.\nOn a layover in Atlanta on his way home on Jan. 6, Witcher deleted most of the videos and photos he had taken at the Capitol. The complaint says he “saw what was happening on the news, and felt the videos could be self-incriminating.” However, during Witcher’s interview with the FBI on Jan. 26, 2021, the complaint says agents located files in his iPhone’s folder of deleted pictures.",

Worrell had a loaded handgun, handcuffs, knives, and boxes of ammunition in his car at the time, according to a 2009 news release from the Collier County Sheriff’s Office in Florida.

One video appears to show Cavanaugh on the first floor of the Capitol in the Small House Rotunda. At one point, according to an FBI affidavit, a man taking the video shouts, “Where are the f****** traitors at? Drag them out by their f****** hair,” seemingly referring to U.S. senators and representatives, and Cavanaugh responds off camera with “Yeah!” While participating in the riot, Cavanaugh wore a hat with the name of his firearm training academy, Tactical Citizen, according to the FBI. Cavanaugh's LinkedIn page states he served on \"multiple security details protecting U.S. Presidents Bush and Obama, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of State.\" The profile also mentions that he \"provided armed internal security to U.S. diplomatic and consular facilities and protected U.S. citizens, government property and classified material and equipment.\" Cavanaugh served in the U.S. Marines from 2003 to 2011 and was deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, a Marine Corps spokesperson confirmed.

Federal prosecutors allege McKellop can be seen in multiple videos from that day wearing a gas mask and helmet, fighting with a line of police officers guarding the U.S. Capitol and trying to grab their pepper spray. McKellop was identified by a couple of tipsters, including one who claimed they served with him and recognized the military \"kit\" he was wearing during the riot. The witness said the kit included a helmet and ballistic vest which resembled what he wore \"in an overseas combat zone in 2018,\" according to the criminal complaint. In one video, a patch that is a symbol of the U.S. Army Special Forces can also be seen on McKellop’s backpack. According to McKellop's memorandum in opposition to pre-trial detention, he served in the Army for more than two decades and spent nine years of that time in the Special Forces. McKellop honorably retired in 2010, with 3 Bronze Stars and a Meritorious Service Award.",

The indictment says Donohoe interfered with police officers’ crowd-control efforts by helping to push people up the steps and into the Capitol. When the Proud Boys’ chairman was arrested two days before the Jan. 6 riot, Donohoe became concerned police would find the Proud Boys’ encrypted communications, the indictment says. The indictment alleges Donohoe created a new channel on the group's encrypted messaging application the evening of Jan. 4, 2021, and instructed others to “Stop everything immediately” and that “this comes from the top.” Later, Donohoe celebrated the events of Jan. 6 by posting a message that “we stormed the capitol unarmed … and then we took it over unarmed,” according to the indictment. In an episode of the “Leatherneck Reconnect” series on YouTube posted in February 2019, Donohoe said: “The only things that I care about are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness ... Anyone that doesn’t agree with that is a traitor, and they deserve a traitor’s death.” According to court records, Donohoe served in the Marines for four years and then as a military contractor for six years.",

In the interview, he gives his name, says he was in the group that pushed through a door locked by the \"cops\" to let rioters through another entrance. He says he was there because of \"election integrity\" and because he believes former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election.

About a week after the riot, the Times Leader newspaper in Pennsylvania published a report based on photos taken inside the Capitol, questioning whether Scavo was among the rioters. At the time, Scavo denied he breached the building. But during a subsequent interview with FBI agents, federal prosecutors contend, Scavo \"claimed he was pushed inside the Capitol due to the movement of the large crowd and was unable to resist getting pushed into the building.\" Federal prosecutors said the FBI reviewed footage Scavo recorded as he breached the Capitol but could not corroborate his claim. At one point, Scavo allegedly recorded himself inside the Capitol saying, \"This is top-secret s***. We’re in the Capitol. Stormed the f****** Capitol of the f****** United States at 58 years old. What the f*** is wrong with America?\" In another video described by federal prosecutors, Scavo allegedly said, \"Your own personal tour of the freaking Capitol. We f****** took it back. Took it back.” According to the Times Leader, Scavo's defense attorney, Ernie Preate Jr., said that his client intends to plead not guilty to all charges and said, \"Mr. Scavo is entitled to a fair shake.

Instant Messenger records from Aho’s account included in the affidavit show the couple were nervous on Jan. 21, 2021, after Dresch’s arrest. \"Every time we hear someone outside we freak tf out,” Aho wrote. “Last one straight says fb friend turned him in. … idk man I might get f**ked.” Publicly available court records do not indicate that Aho is facing charges.",

The Rochester, Minn., woman was actually arrested by police that day. According to court documents, she was apprehended inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, put in zip-tie handcuffs and driven to a police station for processing. She was reportedly released later that evening without any charge. Afterward, White allegedly continued to post comments and links about the riot on her Facebook page. Among the posts: an interview of a woman who identifies herself as “Victoria” and says she was part of the mob pushing to get into the Capitol. “There’s police there and they’re spraying mace,” the woman in the interview allegedly says. “I’m getting beat in the head with a metal baton by the police, and I’m getting massively sprayed with pepper spray by the police … and the next thing I know I’m in the State [sic] Capitol.” Court documents point to that interview, surveillance photos and videos of White as proof that she was in the Capitol that day and forced her way into a lower terrace tunnel.\n",

That officer, according to a federal filing, hit her head on the stairs behind her and lost consciousness. Randolph then allegedly assaulted two other Capitol Police officers, the filing says. Federal agents used an \"open source facial comparison tool\" to find a photo he was in on an acquaintance's Instagram account. Through social media searches, the FBI identified Randolph and followed him to work on March 3, 2021, noting that he appeared to be wearing the same gray hat and black jacket shown in the videos of the riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Two undercover agents then spoke to Randolph, who acknowledged being in the crowd at the U.S. Capitol and that \"it was f****** fun.\"",

One photo shows him on the steps of the Capitol building, embracing a person wearing a rubber mask shaped like a bald eagle. Simon reportedly deleted many of the posts, but FBI agents tracked him down via a search of publicly available databases. When agents called him, Simon asked if they were contacting him about being in the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, court documents say. He then admitted that while he was in the picture on the steps of the Capitol, he was not in the building, and he denied taking any photos or video that day, documents say. However, law enforcement was able to identify him by comparing the Facebook photos with surveillance videos that appear to show him walking through the Capitol, the documents say. ",

Petrosh's mother reportedly told the grandmother that her son went inside the U.S. Capitol on the day of the insurrection. The tipster didn't have any images of him, but based on that information, law enforcement tracked down images in surveillance footage that appear to depict Petrosh inside the Capitol. Petrosh, law enforcement was told, had been \"lying low\" after a number of individuals were charged in the Capitol riot in the weeks after Jan. 6, 2021, court documents say. Furthermore, the court records show that the investigation led to a current FBI Task Force officer, who has known Petrosh for about 15 years.  The officer identified him from screenshots and said that not only had he worked with and attended social gatherings with Petrosh, he had also seen him gardening on occasion. Petrosh was arrested on May 5, 2021. According to a sentencing memorandum filed in federal court, Petrosh served in the U.S. Marines from 1987 to 1991 and fought in Operation Desert Storm. Petrosh has co-owned a party rental business since the late 1990s, according to the memorandum.",

The tipster heard him say he smoked a joint inside the U.S. Capitol and that a police officer told him to leave, but he refused.  Warmus also played a video at the dentist that he had taken while he was inside the Capitol. The tipster said they heard it but didn't see it.  Federal agents tracked down DMV and passport photos and compared them to footage given to them by a film crew in which Warmus says he runs an auto shop in Orchard Park, N.Y. In the video he's wearing a sweatshirt that reads \"CNN is fake news,\" a hat that says Trump 2020 on it, and he holds a tree branch with a large flag on it that says: \"F*** ANTIFA\" in white letters. Security footage from inside the Capitol shows a person who looks like Warmus entering the building, going up the stairs to the second floor, taking photos and video, and briefly struggling with a police officer.  Comparisons to Warmus' driver's license and passport photos convinced the FBI that the footage is of Warmus, and a search warrant served on Verizon, Warmus' cell service provider, shows that his telephone was near a site that provides coverage to an area that includes the inside of the Capitol. Warmus owns the Worm-A-Fix Automotive shop and was arrested on May 18, 2021.",

The FBI claims that the Proud Boys from Arizona, which Jackson congregated with on Jan. 6, 2021, seemed to have chosen the color orange to show they were associated with one another. By matching CCTV from the Capitol to when Jackson allegedly posted content to his social media, they were able to identify him as being in the Capitol, and in particular in National Statuary Hall. During a March 24, 2021, interview with FBI agents, Jackson allegedly said he entered the Capitol without authorization and acknowledged that he was the individual whom law enforcement had identified on CCTV footage. He also claimed that while he was with the Proud Boys on Jan. 6, 2021, he had traveled to the nation's capital by himself and had only wanted to find other people from Arizona. Jackson served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 2015 to 2017 and reached the rank of Lance Corporal, a spokesperson from the Marines confirmed to NPR.

Breheny, a member of the Oath Keepers, served as the coordinator of the Bergen County, N.J., chapter of the organization, according to court documents. On Jan. 3, 2021, Breheny is believed to have held a leadership meeting for the Oath Keepers of the Mid-Atlantic region in Quarryville, Pa., to prepare for the rally on Jan. 6, 2021, according to the FBI. \n\n“This will be the day we get our comms on point with multiple other patriot groups, share rally points etc. This one is important and I believe this is our last chance to organize before the show. This meeting will be for leaders only,” he wrote to the group.  \n\nOn Jan. 14, 2021, Breheny was interviewed by law enforcement about his involvement on Jan. 6, 2021, but further investigation revealed that he lied to the FBI on multiple occasions about his actions that day. Breheny stated to the officers that he was unwillingly pushed inside the building by the large group and did not engage in violence. Footage, however, shows Breheny in close proximity to ongoing violence involving assault on police officers with flagpoles and irritants, as well as communication between him and other members of the Oath Keepers on the platform Signal that read, “We breached the door Baby” and “Made it in Brother.” \nIn addition, Breheny indicated on the same chat that he is deleting all his social media posts in order to avoid being caught. Breheny goes by the alias “Seamus Evers.” \n",

Dolan participated in an encrypted group chat (called \"OK FL DC OP Jan 6\") with the Oath Keepers using the app Signal, prosecutors allege. Two days before the riot, Dolan rented a van and traveled to Washington, D.C., with another defendant from Florida, Kenneth Harrelson, prosecutors say. Around 2:40 p.m. on the day of riot, Dolan and Harrelson joined a military-style \"stack\" formation with other alleged members of the Oath Keepers and breached the Capitol building, according to the federal allegations. The group then moved into the Capitol Rotunda, and Dolan and Harrelson allegedly remained inside the building until 2:57 p.m. Around 4 p.m., prosecutors say, Dolan joined with other Oath Keepers near the Capitol, including the organization's leader, Stewart Rhodes. Rhodes is identified as \"Person 1\" in the indictment and has not been charged in connection with the Capitol breach. A spokesperson for the United States Marine Corps confirmed to NPR that Dolan served in the Marines for nearly 20 years and reached the rank of Staff Sergeant.

On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, prosecutors allege, Hackett and other Oath Keepers members \"prepared themselves for battle before heading to the Capitol by equipping themselves with communication devices and donning reinforced vests, helmets, and goggles.\" Just after 2:30 p.m. on that day, Hackett and other Oath Keepers members formed a military-style \"stack\" formation and \"forcibly entered\" the Capitol, according to prosecutors.

Agents traced his route from Georgia to Washington, D.C., through credit card statements, transit records and hotel charges. When FBI agents spoke with Creek and his attorney, Creek admitted to his involvement and confirmed his identity in photos shown to him of the riot, court documents say. The assaults on law enforcement were also shown to Creek, who said the video did look like him but that he didn't remember \"assaulting any officer.\" Creek described his movements that day in \"great detail,\" according to court documents, and disclosed he was armed with Mace and a boot knife at the Capitol.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Hostetter is a former police chief in La Habra, Calif. In the 1980s, prior to his law enforcement career, Hostetter served in the U.S.  Army and has said he was stationed in West Germany. After the election, Hostetter used his group to “advocate violence,” prosecutors allege in those records. In a November YouTube video, Hostetter supported then-President Donald Trump’s false claims the election had been stolen, and allegedly said, in response, that “tyrants and traitors need to be executed as an example.” At a “Stop the Steal” rally on Dec. 12, 2020, in Huntington Beach, Calif., Hostetter allegedly told a crowd that “execution is the just punishment for the ringleaders of this coup.” According to a criminal indictment of Hostetter and others, Hostetter helped coordinate plans for a pro-Trump rally on Jan. 6, 2021, with members of the extremist anti-government militia known as the Three Percenters. Prosecutors say those plans were developed on the encrypted messaging app Telegram and included discussions of bringing protective gear, weapons and the use of radios. At around 2:30 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, Hostetter, along with another defendant, Russell Taylor, joined rioters on the west side of the Capitol, “pushing through a line of law enforcement officers trying to hold them back,” court documents say.

After Trump called for a “wild” protest on Jan. 6, 2021, Taylor made plans to travel to Washington, D.C., with others, the records say. In one Telegram message described in court documents, Taylor said he was planning to be at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and wrote, “I personally want to be on the front steps and be one of the first ones to breach the doors!” Prosecutors say Taylor also created a channel on Telegram called the California Patriots-DC Brigade, which attracted more than 30 participants. In that channel, Taylor allegedly asked for members to describe any military or law enforcement experience they had, and said, “I am assuming that you have some type of weaponry that you are bringing with you.” On Jan. 5, 2021, Taylor spoke at a pro-Trump rally in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, where he allegedly pledged that “we will fight and we will bleed before we allow our freedom to be taken from us.” On Jan. 6, 2021, prosecutors allege, Taylor carried a protective “plate-carrier vest” as well as a knife and a “stun baton.” At around 2:30 p.m. that day, Taylor and Hostetter joined rioters on the west side of the Capitol “pushing through a line of law enforcement officers trying to hold them back,” court documents say.

Morss is allegedly seen in photos and videos from Jan. 6, 2021, wearing camouflage, a tactical vest and a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. In a crowd trying to push past law enforcement in the Lower West Terrace area of the U.S. Capitol grounds, Morss can be seen on police body camera footage trying to take a police baton away from an officer and later grabbing a fence held by officers and ripping it away, according to court documents. He can allegedly be heard saying to officers: \"You guys are betraying us. You get paid enough to betray your people?” and “[T]ake a look around, back up, we are going to take our Capitol back.” In a YouTube video from a tunnel leading into the Capitol, he is seen pushing into and taking a riot shield away from an officer and sending it back into the crowd, where he directs them to form a \"shield wall,\" according to court documents. Rioters then yelled, \"Heave ho,\" as they pushed in unison against the officers guarding the doors, court documents indicate. Morss eventually left the tunnel and could later be seen climbing through a broken window into the Capitol, court documents say. According to court documents, Morss is a combat veteran. He was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army after serving three tours of duty in Afghanistan.",

While the Capitol riot was ongoing, Grods allegedly rode in a golf cart with others members of the Oath Keepers to the Capitol, then breached the building while carrying what prosecutors describe as a \"large stick.\" Soon after, Grods exited the building as law enforcement used pepper balls to try to force people out of the Capitol, the court documents state. Later, he allegedly met with other members of the Oath Keepers outside the Capitol building, and, in the days after the riot, said he had deleted his messages on Signal. As part of a plea agreement, Grods has agreed to testify in court and sit for interviews with investigators. ",

Body camera footage allegedly shows Neumann wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat and wearing a gas mask for some of the time, and yelling at one officer a common QAnon conspiracy theory that the officer is “defending the people who are going to kill your f**king children ... they are gonna kill your f**king children, they are gonna rape them, they are gonna imprison them, and you’re defending the people that are going to do this to your children.” According to court documents, Neumann refused orders by police to move back, and later, after a violent back and forth over the barricade along with other rioters, wrested it from the officers’ hands and used it as a battering ram to break the police line. FBI agents say they identified Neumann in multiple ways: via an anonymous tipster claiming to be a family friend, by comparing passport photos and social media profiles, and by analyzing data obtained from Google that places a mobile device with a number that Neumann confirmed was his geographically within the Capitol at the time of the riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",

Footage reportedly shows Moerschel wearing a long-sleeved black jacket and backward green baseball cap with Oath Keepers insignia. The group has been known to target and recruit active-duty members of the military and veterans, in part for their specialized skills. According to the FBI, the Oath Keepers believe a cabal of elites has co-opted the federal government by actively trying to strip Americans of their rights. Credit card transactions and intercepted messaging platforms reportedly show group members coordinated their actions ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021 rally, allegedly bringing weapons with them. According to court documents, they stored firearms at a northern Virginia hotel they referred to as “QRF,” or Quick Reaction Force. The FBI says the government obtained surveillance video from the Comfort Inn Ballston on Jan. 7, 2021, showing three individuals wheeling a concierge cart with at least one long gun case onto an elevator. Moerschel reportedly appears to be one of the individuals. The government was able to gain access to a Signal group messaging account used by members of the Oath Keepers, including Moerschel, who wrote under the name \"Hatsy.\"  A search warrant executed on the number used by that user connected the FBI to Moerschel, court documents say.",

Duong continued conversations about surveillance of the U.S. Capitol into February, and in March brought into the group a person alleged to be a member of the Three Percenters, a far-right extremist group. Duong also allegedly continued to share information about his activities on the day of the riot, including videos he had taken.

Entrekin arrived at the mall too late for the speech but made his way with the crowd to the Capitol and entered the building at least twice.  A video he took of himself shows he recorded everything live for his mother to watch upon his return home. “Wow, Mom. I wish you were here with me. It’s really exciting in here. It’s joyful and it’s sad at the same time. We can’t let Biden ... to be our president. We can’t ... there’s no way,” he can be heard saying on the video.

On the day of the Capitol riot, federal prosecutors allege, Dempsey wore an American flag-themed neck gaiter as well as a combat-style helmet, camouflage pants and a tactical vest. In one video described in court documents, Dempsey stood in front of a gallows erected outside the Capitol and said that Democrats in Congress \"need to hang from these motherf****** [pointing to gallows],\" and that \"Hopefully one day soon we really have someone hanging from one of these motherf******.\" During the riot, Dempsey allegedly used a lacrimal agent -- such as pepper spray -- as well as a crutch and a metal pole to attack police officers guarding the Capitol building. Dempsey was arrested in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2019 over allegedly using bear spray to attack anti-Trump protesters there. Dempsey pleaded no contest to a charge stemming from that incident. The Justice Department notes in its court filings that Dempsey can be seen in multiple photos from Jan. 6 wearing a black- and yellow-colored bracelet. Black and yellow are the colors associated with the far-right extremist group known as the Proud Boys. In one photo described in court documents, Dempsey made  the OK sign while standing next to people wearing Proud Boys attire. The \"OK\" sign, which the Proud Boys frequently use, is often associated with supporters of white supremacy, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Dempsey was arrested on Aug. 26, 2021. ",

He allegedly said in that group chat on Jan. 6, 2021, that “I just spoke to Peggy Hall she said we need to meet.\" Hall is a far-right activist from California who opposes vaccination and the use of masks to mitigate COVID-19, and who was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Hall is not facing any criminal charges related to the Capitol riot. On Jan. 15, 2021, Martin gave an interview to FBI investigators, court documents say, and claimed that he was at the Capitol attempting to calm demonstrators who had gathered at the doors of the building.

According to court documents, the pushed officer loses his balance and falls down a set of stairs. A different individual then proceeds to spray that officer with a fire extinguisher in the face. As Eckerman makes his way further in, he is seen pushing several other officers, court records indicate. Once back outside, Eckerman is reportedly captured on video discussing his motivation for going inside and also comments on the shooting of Ashli Babbitt. “I don’t know her name, all I know is we went there (Capitol) as patriots. She is dead because we’re here. These mother f***ers are traitors, they are f***ing traitors!” he allegedly says. ",

The criminal complaint states that the witness pointed law enforcement to pictures of Brown in tactical gear the day before the riot -- even though the witness wasn't sure if he'd actually entered the Capitol during the incident itself. The FBI reportedly verified his location by comparing a photo from the day before to video and pictures taken on Jan. 6, 2021, where he appeared to be wearing the same gear, including zip ties attached to his belt. Police body worn camera footage also allegedly showed him near the Capitol where he was one of a group trying to push back against law enforcement attempting to secure the building grounds. According to court documents, Brown has not been placed by the FBI inside the Capitol building that day, but cellphone data shows that a number used by Brown was in a geographic area that includes the inside of the building. According to court documents, another defendant identified him, and said that he'd provided a ride share to Washington, D.C., coordinating on a Signal chat and through posts on Parler. In a Parler post, Brown allegedly identified himself as a \"retired Green Beret that ran for Fl-14\" under his account, @brownforcongress2020. On Signal, he allegedly wrote: \"If you can, come to my house anytime Saturday. You can stop by and drop stuff off, or stay the night.

    "summary": "Court documents say that Aiden Bilyard helped break one of the windows through which many people, including Bilyard, breached the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Bilyard can allegedly be seen in multiple images from that day — some of them show a young man with long, dirty-blond hair, wearing a black jacket over a gray hoodie that appears to read “Harvard.” Later, Bilyard was dubbed #HarvardSweats by the online group Sedition Hunters, which sought to identify some of the people who breached the Capitol that day. According to the charging documents, Bilyard was among the throng of rioters clutching a large gold canister of what is believed to be “bear spray,” which he sprayed at a group of police officers trying to secure the building. An officer who was on the receiving end of that spray found himself incapacitated by it. Later in the afternoon, Bilyard is allegedly seen in video footage egging on another rioter who's trying to break a window of the Capitol. According to court documents, Bilyard was handed a bat, shattered the window and entered a Senate room through the broken window. Bilyard was reportedly identified from a previous booking photo and a Facebook profile associated with him in which he can be seen wearing the Harvard sweatshirt. Later, Bilyard’s mother reportedly retrieved the hoodie and gave it to the FBI. Agents followed up with Bilyard later when he was in basic training for the U.S. Air Force, where he allegedly admitted that he was on the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, 2021, but said he did not break any laws. When he was shown videos of his apparent participation in unlawful activities, he ended his conversation with the FBI, saying, “I think this is where I take my leave.”",

    "summary": "Federal prosecutors allege that Edward Badalian conspired over the encrypted chat-app Telegram to travel to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021, carrying \"weapons and tactical gear\" such as a \"taser, pepper spray, a baseball bat, gas masks, and walkie talkies\" to ultimately disrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election. In December 2020, after then-President Donald Trump called for a rally on Jan. 6, 2021, Badalian allegedly messaged a Telegram group called PATRIOTS 45 MAGA Gang and said, \"we need to violently remove traitors and if they are in key positions rapidly replace them with able bodied Patriots.\" Prosecutors allege that Badalian was traveling with another defendant, Daniel Rodriguez, and that Rodriguez wrote to the chat on Jan. 5, 2021: \"There will be blood. Welcome to the revolution.\" On the day of the riot, Badalian, Rodriguez and others gathered by the western side of the U.S. Capitol, court documents state. Rodriguez has been accused of using an \"electroshock weapon\" to attack an officer with the Metropolitan Police Department, identified by various news sources to be Mike Fanone. Rodriguez is also accused of using a flagpole as a weapon and breaking into the Capitol building. Badalian also allegedly breached the Capitol through a broken window. Two days after the riot, prosecutors allege, Badalian called into an Infowars show under the pseudonym \"Turbo\" and claimed he fought off a man from the anti-fascist movement antifa who was breaking windows at the Capitol. (There is no evidence that antifa supporters participated in the Capitol riot.) Though Badalian allegedly used the name \"Turbo\" to conceal his identity, a subsequent caller referred to him as \"Ed\" on the Infowars broadcast. ",

    "summary": "James Beeks was allegedly part of a group of Oath Keepers members and affiliates that marched on the U.S Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Prosecutors say that he was already on the radar of law enforcement after a rioter who pleaded guilty identified him as one of the people who lined up with the Oath Keepers the day of the riot. The criminal complaint alleges that he was part of the group that entered into a formation — called a “stack” — in order to force its way into the Capitol. Court documents enumerate many records obtained that show Beeks traveled to Washington, D.C., on the day of the riot, including records from a personal finance app and a rental car agency, as well as cellphone records. Beeks was not wearing the typical camouflage favored by the far-right extremist group, according to court documents, but instead appears in images from that day in a black jacket with the word “Bad” on it in red letters, from Michael Jackson's 1987 world tour. It is that jacket that helped lead law enforcement to him; agents found photographs on Instagram of a person who appears to be Beeks wearing the jacket while posing in front of a sign for the musical play Jesus Christ Superstar. Beeks is an actor who performs as Judas — under the stage name James T. Justis — in the traveling production of the play, and the criminal complaint notes he was observed performing the role in both San Francisco and Los Angeles. In addition, he has also performed as a Michael Jackson impersonator. Prosecutors claim that Beeks changed his phone and phone number the day after an indictment naming co-conspirators was filed and registered his new phone under his stage name. After Beeks was charged, he appeared in court and claimed that the U.S. government had no authority over him — which a U.S. District judge called “gobbledygook.” The production of Jesus Christ Superstar has since replaced him in the role of Judas.",

Once inside, Franklin allegedly followed people onto the floor of the Senate and observed “a shirtless man with an animal skin headdress and his face painted red, white, and blue stood at the speaker's chair, wielding a bullhorn, and flexing his biceps” who was presumably Jacob Chansley, also known as the QAnon Shaman. Months after the riot, agents say they tracked Franklin down at his house, executed a search warrant and seized gear that they claim can be seen in images of that day and in particular the footage from the Senate floor: a Trump 2020 Keep America Great flag, a plaid patterned shirt, a pair of Nike shoes and a baseball cap emblazoned with “United States of America” and a flag in the center.

One wrote: \"This individual has been talking about overthrowing the government for weeks in public chat rooms pushing disinformation and talking about hanging and executing people repetitively ... He claims to have been in the Capitol Building on the 6th of January and has posted multiple disturbing videos which would seem to substantiate this statement.\" The tipster including a screenshot of the Parler account, which appeared to show Michael Oliveras' name and phone number, which the FBI then verified and located as having been near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, court records indicate. The FBI then reviewed Oliveras' Parler account, where they allegedly found video taken inside and around the Capitol on the day of the riot. In one video, Oliveras allegedly shows a pile of news media equipment strewn on the ground outside and says \"“That’s what happens when the f***ing fake news shows up at a Patriot rally.\" In another video showing a mob of people inside the building, Oliveras allegedly says: “Where are the f***ing traitors?

    "summary": "The FBI received two tips that Jonas Buxton was at the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. The first, according to charging documents, came from a person married to one of Buxton's family members, who said that they had been told Buxton participated in the riot and may have been carrying an AR-15 rifle. A second tipster reportedly said that Buxton quit his store job after arrests related to Jan. 6, 2021, were announced and \"went into hiding.\" The FBI continued to investigate Buxton's involvement, identifying a cellphone number associated with Buxton, according to court records. Google data obtained by the FBI showed that that cell number was inside the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, and court documents show a map of the phone's movements on that day. In April of 2021, Buxton flew into Miami from Panama City and was flagged by a Customs and Border Protection officer for secondary search, during which the officer was able to look at Buxton's phone. The customs officer allegedly found several photos of Buxton wearing a tactical vest with a \"Trump\" patch in the center, including one showing him holding a large gun in front of a Christmas tree and another in a red gaiter and red hat worn backwards. The officer also allegedly discovered a letter from the \"Three Percenters,\" a far-right extremist group, with a \"call to action\" to go to Washington, D.C., on the day of the riot, saying that the president had called them there that day. Federal prosecutors say that surveillance footage from inside the Capitol that day show someone who appears to be Buxton -- wearing the vest with the \"Trump\" patch and a red gaiter around his neck.",

For weeks prior, Boughner wrote multiple social media entries questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election and calling Joe Biden “stupid,” according to court records. Boughner first came to the attention of the FBI in the spring of 2021 when FBI agents reviewed police body-worn camera footage that allegedly shows Boughner assaulting an officer with a chemical spray. Subsequently, the FBI issued a BOLO alert for the then-unidentified Boughner. In addition, the volunteer group Sedition Hunters assigned a moniker to the person who federal prosecutors say is Boughner: “#blackpufferwhitescarf.\" According to the FBI, Boughner was identified by a tattoo of a five-point star below a dragon on the inside of his left wrist. At the end of July 2021, a search warrant was issued to a Facebook account that matched Boughner. The subscriber data provided by Facebook allegedly confirmed he was indeed at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. On the day of the riot, he allegedly posted: “I grabbed a can from them and started spraying. I got it on video lol …That was wild.

    "summary": "Elmer Stewart Rhodes III, who goes by his middle name, is a former Army paratrooper, a graduate of Yale Law School and the founder and leader of the far-right, anti-government group the Oath Keepers. Federal prosecutors allege that Rhodes and other members of the Oath Keepers committed seditious conspiracy by plotting to “oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power,” which culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. That conspiracy, the indictment against Rhodes states, began shortly after the November 2020 presidential election. On Nov. 7, 2020, Rhodes allegedly sent a message to other Oath Keepers in which he said, “We must now do what the people of Serbia did when [President Slobodan] Milosevic stole their election - Refuse to accept it and march en-mass [sic] to the nation’s Capitol.” Later, Rhodes allegedly messaged other Oath Keepers that if Joe Biden assumed office, “it will be a bloody and desperate fight. We are going to have a fight. It can’t be avoided.” Throughout this period, the Justice Department alleges, members of the Oath Keepers communicated over encrypted channels and conducted training in techniques such as “unconventional warfare.” In the lead-up to Jan. 6, 2021, Rhodes allegedly purchased thousands of dollars' worth of firearms and other military-style equipment, such as night-vision goggles and ammunition, and the Oath Keepers discussed plans to have an armed “quick reaction force” available just outside Washington, D.C., prepared to bring “heavy weapons” to the city at a moment’s notice. On the day of the Capitol attack, Rhodes allegedly entered restricted Capitol grounds and was in communication with members of the Oath Keepers who formed military-style stack formations as they breached the Capitol building. There is no evidence that Rhodes entered the building himself. The Justice Department alleges that later that evening, Rhodes had dinner with members of the Oath Keepers “to celebrate their attack on the Capitol and discuss next steps.” In the days after, Rhodes allegedly purchased thousands of dollars of additional weapons and other military-style equipment and encouraged people to form militias to oppose the Biden administration. Rhodes has publicly denied any wrongdoing and defended members of the group who breached the Capitol building. “I don't think they did anything wrong. I don't think they committed any crimes,\" Rhodes said in July. “Do I think it was stupid? Yeah. Because it left our enemies a chance to demonize and persecute them. But I do not disavow them.” Rhodes was arrested on Jan. 13, 2022.",

In addition, court documents say, he said that the group would have both “rifles” and “man power.” Federal prosecutors claim that Vallejo was designated as part of an armed “quick reaction force” (QRF) stationed outside Washington but prepared to bring “heavy weapons” to the city. Two days before the riot, Vallejo messaged alleged co-conspirator Kelly Meggs saying that he was with the “cadre” in Tennessee and “requesting coordinates,” signing off, “For the Republic,” court documents indicate. He arrived in Virginia on Jan. 5, 2021, and was provided the address of the Comfort Inn in Ballston, where he and the rest of the QRF were given firearms and ammunition, according to court documents. On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Vallejo and others were reportedly waiting at the hotel for information from alleged co-conspirators on the ground. Court documents point to a podcast that Vallejo and another Arizona team member appeared on, where they talked about the possibility of “armed conflict” and “guerrilla war” and said, “there are people who are prepared, have the will, have the facilities to do more than taunt.” Later in the day, members of the Oath Keepers allegedly formed military-style stack formations as they breached the U.S. Capitol building. Prosecutors say Vallejo messaged the Signal chat more than once to assert his readiness to step in. Later that night, he was part of a group that included Rhodes that celebrated the attack at a restaurant and talked about how to continue fighting the presidential transition of power, according to court records. The next morning at 5:46 a.m., Vallejo allegedly told the Signal chat that he would “probe their defense line right now,” stating, “Departing for Recon now.” A few days later, an alleged co-conspirator from the Arizona QRF team reportedly wrote to Rhodes as they drove back to Arizona, “wanted to let you know that [Vallejo] and I are here. We are excited to learn next steps and would like to know what we should be doing right now.” Vallejo's attorney stated in federal court that he served in the U.S. Army in the 1970s and was stationed at Ft. Polk in Louisiana.",

He allegedly appeared with members of the group near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and flashed the \"OK\" hand signal, which was popular with the group during the attack. Prosecutors allege that Fischer joined with the mob trying to enter the Capitol through a tunnel by the Lower West Terrace and yelled, \"push!\" as the crowd pushed against police officers. Later, prosecutors allege, Fischer threw an orange traffic cone, a pole and a chair at a line of police officers guarding the Capitol. According to HuffPost, civilians helped identify Fischer by comparing photos of the Capitol riot to photos of Fischer from his work as a fashion model. A spokesperson for the U.S. Air Force confirmed that Fischer served in the Air Force from 2013 to 2017 and reached the rank of senior airman.",

    "summary": "When Matthew Jason Beddingfield allegedly stormed the U.S. Capitol, he was in the midst of legal proceedings on an attempted murder charge. He later pled guilty to a lesser charge. Prosecutors investigating the Capitol insurrection say online sleuths referred to Beddingfield as #soggykidinsider and #nazigrayhat because he appeared wet in some photographs and could apparently be seen performing a Nazi salute. Court documents say private citizens used facial recognition software to connect images of Beddingfield on Jan. 6, 2021, to his mugshot from the attempted murder case. Beddingfield was also the subject of a HuffPost article on the use of facial recognition software by citizen sleuths. The FBI says that while Beddingfield’s father told HuffPost his son was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and had never been there before, public Facebook posts show Beddingfield and his father at the Capitol in November of 2020. The bureau also alleges that Beddingfield’s father wrote in a Facebook post: “WE ARE HERE TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY BACK FROM THOSE COMMIE BASTARDS” and confirmed to a commenter that he was in Washington, D.C. According to court documents, surveillance footage from the Capitol shows Beddingfield jumping a barricade on Capitol grounds and jabbing at law enforcement officers with a flagpole he carried. Prosecutors also allege that after Beddingfield entered the Capitol, he tried to strike police officers with the flagpole.",

On cellphone footage obtained by the FBI, agents claim that he can be heard saying he’s from Austin, Texas. Court documents indicate that Shough was ultimately identified by the FBI through two tipsters who led them to his ex-girlfriend: When agents interviewed her, she said they’d broken up the week before. She allegedly told the FBI that Shough owned a cognac-colored jacket, had said he was interested in attending the “Stop the Steal” rally while in Washington, D.C., and later said she was “fairly certain” that images shown to her were of him. In those images, Shough can allegedly be seen with a decal on his helmet that matches the logo of the Oath Keepers, a far-right extremist organization.

    "summary": "As his fellow Proud Boys allegedly entered the Senate chamber of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Enrique Tarrio posted to social media that he was “Proud of My Boys and my country,” court records indicate. According to the FBI, Tarrio served as the national chair of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, and allegedly helped plan the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Tarrio is charged in an eight-count superseding indictment alongside five other members of Proud Boys leadership. Court documents reportedly show Jan. 6 as the culmination of months of planning by Tarrio and his associates, including the creation of a chapter of the Proud Boys called the “Ministry of Self Defense,” which allegedly existed to make plans for the insurrection. In November 2020, prosecutors say Tarrio posted to social media: “The media constantly accuses us of wanting to start a civil war. Careful what the f*** you ask for we don’t want to start one… but we will sure as f*** finish one.” In December 2020, Tarrio traveled to Washington, D.C., to attend a “Million MAGA” rally and prosecutors say he stole and burned a “Black Lives Matter” banner from a local church. Later in December 2020, Tarrio and other members of Proud Boys leadership allegedly founded the “Ministry of Self Defense” chapter, court documents show. The FBI says that Tarrio emphasized a top-down structure for the group and directed potential members to “fit in... or f*** off.” Prosecutors allege leadership of the “Ministry of Self Defense” group raised money for paramilitary supplies, planned for Proud Boys not to dress in their traditional yellow and black colors, and encouraged members to travel to D.C. for the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6, 2021. An encrypted chat for members of the “Ministry of Self Defense” is alleged to have included at least 65 members. According to the indictment, during this time another individual sent Tarrio plans to occupy several buildings around Washington, writing “the revolution is more important than anything,” to which Tarrio responded: “That’s what every waking moment consists of… I’m not playing games.” Court documents show Tarrio was arrested on a destruction of property charge related to the December flag-burning incident on Jan. 4, 2021. He was released and ordered to leave Washington on Jan. 5, 2021, but met with the founder of the Oath Keepers, as well as others, in an underground parking garage before leaving for Baltimore, Md. He was not physically present during the riot on Jan. 6, prosecutors say. After Tarrio’s arrest, court documents show leadership of the “Ministry of Self Defense” group created a new encrypted chat group that did not include Tarrio, as well as a new membership chat that included about 90 people. After Tarrio’s release, his compatriots allegedly added him to the new chats. During the riot itself, prosecutors allege that while other Proud Boys stole a police officer’s riot shield, broke a window at the Capitol and entered the Capitol itself, Tarrio engaged on social media and by a short phone call to another Proud Boy. Tarrio was indicted on seven charges. Though he was not alongside his fellow Proud Boys on Jan. 6, prosecutors say Tarrio wrote on social media that he was “enjoying the show.”",

The FBI was then able to find witnesses who know Celentano and could identify him in photographs from the insurrection, according to court documents. Additionally, data from EZ Pass and the New York License Plate Reader capture a car owned by a person law enforcement believes to be Celentano's significant other leaving New York early the morning of Jan. 6 and returning the next day. Prosecutors say police body camera footage from the riot depicts Celentano \"engaging in several physical altercations\" with officers. Additionally, other open source video allegedly shows Celentano pushing a police officer over a ledge on the West Terrace of the Capitol. The officer, an Iraq War veteran, suffered minor injuries, but reportedly later stated that he was frightened and thought at the time: \"I didn't survive a war to go out like this.”",

The FBI claims surveillance footage from the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, appears to show Robinson-Hand, formerly known as Mandy Robinson-Lanning, entering the building through the Senate wing door just before 2:30 p.m., holding her cellphone aloft. She and her husband, Charles Hand III, who is also charged, were then filmed walking hand in hand through the Capitol Visitors Center and the Crypt, court documents allege. According to an FBI statement, the video footage shows Robinson-Hand appearing to restrain her husband from advancing toward a scuffle involving police and protesters. Robinson-Hand and her husband were arrested March 11 in Butler, Ga. ",

SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.\" The day before those posts went up, prosecutors say, the Burleson Police Department reported that Garcia indicated on Facebook he’d entered the U.S. Capitol. The FBI says they also found posts from before the Capitol riot that included comments such as “Get ready DC” and “IT’S TIME TO RISE THE F*** UP.” Investigators examining Garcia’s Facebook page also allegedly found GoPro style video footage that they were able to match with CCTV footage from inside the Capitol. The FBI also says Garcia’s childhood friend positively identified him in photos, including from inside the Capitol. The same friend told the FBI that Garcia’s belief in QAnon and other conspiracy theories “changed his behavior.” Through Facebook, investigators say they found a phone number for Garcia that had used cell sites in an area that includes the Capitol and that Garcia called a cannabis delivery service in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021. That phone number is registered to Garcia’s mother, who said that she told investigators she did not travel to Washington and that the number belongs to one of her children.",

He was taken into custody and released without charges that day, according to the FBI statement.

Wilson was a county-level leader of the Oath Keepers based in North Carolina, and he conspired with other members of the group to \"oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power,\" according to a statement of offense Wilson signed and submitted in federal court as part of his guilty plea. In the days and weeks after the November 2020 presidential election, Wilson exchanged messages with other members of the Oath Keepers about how they believed Joe Biden had stolen the election and, as Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes allegedly put it in one message, \"we aren't getting through this without a civil war.\" On Jan. 5, 2021, Wilson drove from North Carolina to a hotel in Vienna, Va., which is near Washington, D.C., and brought with him an \"AR-15-style rifle, a 9-millimeter pistol, approximately 200 rounds of ammunition, body armor, a camouflaged combat uniform, pepper spray, a large walking stick intended for use as a weapon, and a pocketknife,\" court documents state. Some members of the Oath Keepers allegedly remained at the hotel with a stash of weapons in order to act as a \"Quick Reaction Force\" that could bring arms into D.C. \"in case of worst case scenarios,\" as Rhodes reportedly wrote in one message. On the day of the riot, Wilson breached the Capitol and helped force open doors to the building's rotunda, according to court documents. Prosecutors allege that at least 14 Oath Keepers breached the Capitol. Wilson left the building and later that evening gathered with Rhodes and other Oath Keepers at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington, D.C. At one point, court documents state, Rhodes called an unidentified person via speakerphone and \"repeatedly implore[d] the individual to tell President Trump to call upon groups like the Oath Keepers to forcibly oppose the transfer of power.\" The person \"denied Rhodes's request to speak directly with President Trump,\" according to court documents, which do not state what relationship that person may have had to Trump. Afterward, members of the group reportedly had dinner at an Olive Garden restaurant and discussed the possibility of taking further actions to fight the transfer of power. In the days after Jan. 6, Wilson deleted messages and information about the alleged plot and threw his cellphone into the Atlantic Ocean. ",

Prosecutors estimate Kelley spent about 40 minutes inside the Capitol, including in the Senate gallery and the rotunda. He was arrested in May of 2022.",

One of Bokoski’s Facebook posts, which the FBI says it uncovered through a search warrant, allegedly read “...only thing I’m guilty of is trespassing on federal property if you want to get down to it. I kept my distance from police and even thanked them for being out and making sure things don’t get insane.” Prosecutors say Bokoski confirmed his presence in the Capitol in an interview and shared photos with investigators. Bokoski also said in the interview that the rally was effective because it shut down government, court documents show. Bokoski was arrested in May of 2022.",

The Facebook posts were removed, but the FBI was able to track the brothers using cellular data and found records of them flying to Washington, D.C., on the day before the attack, according to court records. Video obtained from U.S. Capitol Police and from open sources allegedly show Adam Lejay Jackson hurling a large orange object at a line of law enforcement officers at the tunnel outside of the Lower West Terrace. His brother is also allegedly seen throwing a flag on a pole at the police. After throwing the orange object, Adam Jackson can be seen charging at the line of officers with riot shields, court records indicate. On Jan. 10, 2021, Adam Jackson exchanged messages with another person, indicating that he wanted to return to Washington, D.C., for the Inauguration: “I’m f***ing pissed at what is happening and the things that are being covered up.” He added: “I’m gonna do my best to get there. Working on it.” ",

Kelley is a candidate in the Republican primary for governor. At a “Stop the Steal” rally in Michigan, prosecutors say Kelley told the crowd, “Covid-19 was made so that they can use the propaganda to control your minds so that you think, if you watch the media, that Joe Biden won this election. We’re not going to buy it. We’re going to stand and fight for America, for Donald Trump. We’re not going to let the Democrats steal this election.” Investigators tracked Kelley’s movements on Capitol grounds through news and online videos, reconstructing a timeline they say includes him waving other people towards the stairs to the Capitol. In many images, prosecutors say Kelley wore aviator sunglasses, a black baseball cap with an American flag, a black coat and a red watch strap. Witnesses who know Kelley positively identified him in photos from Jan. 6, 2021. Kelley was arrested in June of 2022.",

Court documents show when Speed did decide to go into the Capitol, he blamed what he saw as a betrayal by Mike Pence, saying: “I have no respect for people in this building. They have no respect for me.” When he left, the FBI says, Speed claims it was because he thought House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had agreed to a 10-day delay of the vote and an investigation of the election, which was not the case. “It should have gotten to the point where Nancy Pelosi should have resigned out of fear for her life. That’s what should have happened,\" Speed allegedly said.

According to an FBI statement of facts, Robinson caught a ride with friends from the Philadelphia area that morning “to listen to speeches,” but he got separated from them and was then “sucked into a large group of people who were trying to gain access into the Capitol.” Surveillance footage shows Robinson carrying a velvet rope around the Capitol Rotunda for several minutes “enthusiastically pumping his fists into the air while appearing to yell out,” according to the FBI statement. He was arrested on Aug. 5, 2022, in Fort Washington, Pa.",

The second tipster alerted the FBI that Sobotka had shown photos to others from when he was inside the Capitol during the riot, court documents indicate. Sobotka's drivers license photo was run through a government database containing digital multimedia from the riot. According to court records, a match was returned showing an individual outside the East Front of the Capitol. Further analysis of U.S. Capitol Police CCTV footage allegedly showed a person inside the Capitol that matched the clothes and appearance of Sobotka from the selfie sent in by the first tipster. A search of Sobotka's social media accounts also allegedly returned a positive match between him and footage from the Capitol riot.",

    "summary": "Jonathan Copeland was identified to the FBI in the days after the riot at the U.S. Capitol by a witness who said they'd seen him in footage of the day shot by CBS news, court documents indicate. A second witness months later also contacted law enforcement about him. The FBI interviewed Copeland, who said he'd traveled to Washington, D.C., that day with another person he'd met online and went to the rally early in the morning. Court documents indicate he left the speech early and walked with others to the Capitol, where he followed a group of people climbing the scaffolding and went through an open door into the building where he witnessed a standoff between police and rioters. While he was inside, Copeland said he received a phone call from the person he'd traveled with that day, who told him, \"Son, you know what you're doing is a crime,\" according to court records. After that, he said he retraced his steps and a police officer directed him to exit thorugh a window. An open source search of images from Jan. 6, 2021, by law enforcement appear to show Copeland in a variety of places during the day. Videos and photos allegedly show Copeland advancing past barricades, ignoring commands from law enforcement, and joining other rioters in pushing a large, metal \"Trump\" sign into a line of police. Copeland told law enforcement officers during the interview with them that he felt remorse for his actions, which is why he deleted his accounts and disposed of his cellphone. ",
